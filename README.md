# Semantic Systematicity in Connectionist Language Production

Here is the code and trained specimens presented in the paper under review *Semantic Systematicity in Connectionist Language Production*.

[data](https://github.com/iesus/systematicity-sentence-production/tree/main/data) contains the corpus and the different train/test splits. There are some text files that can be used to get an idea of the sentences, but most files are in Pickle format, which is the format the code receives.

[outputs](https://github.com/iesus/systematicity-sentence-production/tree/main/outputs) contains the trained specimens and some outputs of them. Some values reported in the paper need to be rerun as they might not be here, which we will try to fix. However, all specimens in the paper are here, so any further tests or analyses are possible. Each trained neural network is relatively small that is why we can post all our specimens.

[production_main.py](https://github.com/iesus/systematicity-sentence-production/blob/main/production_main.py) is the main file. If you would like to reproduce our results, this is the one you should look at.
